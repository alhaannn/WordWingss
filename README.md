**WordWings - Vocabulary Learning Platform**
https://wordwingss.netlify.app/

`Introduction`
WordWings is an interactive vocabulary learning platform designed to help users expand their language skills through contextual learning and spaced repetition. Unlike traditional flashcard systems, WordWings integrates words into memorable sentences and visual scenarios, making vocabulary retention more natural and engaging.

I built this project to solve my own frustration with language learning apps that focus on isolated word memorization. WordWings helps users understand how words function in real contexts while adapting to individual learning patterns.


`Key Features :-`
* Contextual Learning: Every word comes with 3 usage examples from literature/media

* Adaptive Spaced Repetition: Algorithm adjusts review timing based on performance

* Pronunciation Practice: Voice recording with instant feedback

* Progress Visualization: Interactive learning maps and milestone tracking

* Multi-language Support: Currently English, Spanish, and French

* Community Challenges: Weekly vocabulary competitions
